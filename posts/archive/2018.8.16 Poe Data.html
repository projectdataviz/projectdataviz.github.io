			<h2 class="section-heading">Historical Background</h2>
				<p>Despite his creativity, and success as a writer, Edgar Allan Poe led a very troubled life.  Born Edgar Poe in Boston in 1809 to two actors, Poe never knew his biological parents.  His father left the family when he was one, and his mother died the following year.  Fortunately, Poe was taken in by the Allan's, a wealthy family in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
				<p>The Allan's raised Poe in their family, though never legally adopted him.  Though they provided for nearly all of his wants and needs, Poe and his foster father often fought over finances, his education and vices.  While a student at the University of Virginia, Poe's gambling habit got out of hand and he gambled away his tuition.  With John Allan unwilling to foot the bill any longer, Poe left the University.</p>
				<p>Unable to support himself without financial assistance from the Allans, and unsure of his next move, Poe enlisted in the U.S. Army.  That same year,  he anonymously published his first volume of works, 'Tamerlane and Other Poems.'  Poe did much better in the Army than his first book did, but after two years in the service was ready to move on to his next opportunity.  At this same time, the only mother figure he'd ever known, Frances Allan passed away.</p>
				<p>Though tragic, this event did mend the rift between Poe and John Allan, and paved the way for Poe to leave the Army early and enroll in the US Military Academy at West Point.  Prior to beginning his term at West Point he published his second book, 'Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems' in 1829.  Poe and Allan's reconciliation was short lived, and not long after starting his officer training at West Point, Allan disowned Poe and left him to fend for himself.</p>
				<p>Similar to his time at the University of Virginia, Poe found himself on the wrong side of the administration and out of money to fund his education.  Unwilling to reconcile with Allan and unable to follow the rules, Poe sought out the opportunity to be court-martialed so he could leave the school.</p>
				<p>Prior to leaving, he did use his rapport with his fellow cadets (and his reputation for writing humorous verses about the commanding officers at the Academy) to raise funds to publish his third book, 'Second Edition' in 1831.  Without somewhere to call home, Poe moved to Baltimore to live with family and began to pursue a writing career in earnest.</p>
				<p>Poe found work as a literary critic with multiple periodicals, some of which he would depend upon to publish some of his poems and earliest attempts at prose.  Poe found his muse in his 13 year old cousin Virginia who, though only half his age, he married in 1836.  While married to Virginia, Poe struggled with alcoholism, which only became worse when she began showing symptoms of tuberculosis. This dark period of Poe's life led to some of his most well recognized works, including 'The Raven.'</p>
				<p>Virginia lost her battle with tuberculosis in early 1847 and Poe tried to move on, however his alcoholism and tendency to act erratically - he once made a baseless accusation of plagiarism against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow - prevented his success in this area.</p>
				<p>Poe died under a shroud of mystery with the exact cause of his death unknown.  Found delirious on the streets of Baltimore outside a tavern in another man's clothes, he was taken to the hospital for treatment.  He never recovered enough to provide any details on how he came to be in Baltimore (he was last known to be in New York), or how he ended up on the street.  In his delirium, he shouted 'Reynolds.'  There are several theories about who or what he may have been referring, though we'll never know for sure.</p>
				<p>Poe never received the recognition for his work during his lifetime, but now you can immortalize his work in a data viz!
